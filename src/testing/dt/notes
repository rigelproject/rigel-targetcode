block UG(uniform grid)
use uniform grid not only to index into v, but to contain the acctual vertices, to improve locality 
but this might be not too helpful, maybe we need the UG to index,
but into a more organaized set of points
Think about recursively reerange the point set by several closest neighbors
block hash table, look into it
checktetra in first tetra is expensive
rethink first terta creation, maybe start from left and restrict points outside boubdaries


to do master slave approach I have to enqueue only to local queue to enforce list synchronization
